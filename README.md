# ProtoSchool Hangzhou

Welcome to the Hangzhou chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

We are a group of people passionate about the decentralized web and excited to learn, teach, and share ideas. Everyone is welcome!

We are all fans of **Decentralized Storage Network** and **web3.0** based on IPFS or filecoin dev by [Protocol Lab](https://protocol.ai/). And we are trying our best to explore and bring some interesting ideas into reality using based tools by IPFS. Hopefully we can make the world better.
